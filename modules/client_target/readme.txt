The original purpose of the target module was to create a module in which will make it easy to control access to node pages as well as views displays depending on taxonomy terms attached to the node and to the user. If the user does not have a particular taxonomy term tag attached then the user should not have access to the content tagged with the associated term. Many other options were explored however required the use of Drupal permission system. With a large number of permutations I have found handling access through permissions to grow in complexity exponentially. Through this module the user can control access to a page based on a one to one match between content and the user, and does not require access to be controlled through the use of a role or permission rather fields which are attached to content and users.
